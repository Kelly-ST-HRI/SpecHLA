CMake Warning at cmake/Modules/LibFindMacros.cmake:263 (message):
  WARNING: MISSING PACKAGE

  We could not find development headers for HTSlib.  Do you have the
  necessary dev package installed? This package is NOT REQUIRED and you may
  ignore this warning but by doing so you may miss some functionality of
  SpecHap.

  Relevant CMake configuration variables:

    HTSlib_INCLUDE_DIR=<not found>
    HTSlib_LIBRARY=<not found>

  You may use CMake GUI, cmake -D or ccmake to modify the values.  Delete
  CMakeCache.txt to discard all values and force full re-detection if
  necessary.

Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake/Modules/Findhtslib.cmake:45 (libfind_process)
